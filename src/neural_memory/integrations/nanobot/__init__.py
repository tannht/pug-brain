"""Nanobot integration for PugBrain.

Provides PugBrain tools that conform to Nanobot's Tool interface,
plus a drop-in MemoryStore replacement backed by the neural graph.

Usage::

    from neural_memory.integrations.nanobot import setup_neural_memory

    nm_store = await setup_neural_memory(registry, workspace, brain_id="my-brain")
    # Tools are now registered. nm_store can replace Nanobot's MemoryStore.
